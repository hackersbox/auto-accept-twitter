AutoApprove - X Followers ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data and why we do not collect your personal information.

## 1. No Data Collection
The Extension **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personal data, browsing history, or X (Twitter) account credentials. All processing happens locally on your computer.

## 2. Technical Functionality
The Extension requires access to `x.com` and `twitter.com` specifically to:
- Detect "Accept" buttons on the `/follower_requests` page.
- Automate the clicking of these buttons as initiated by the user.
- Observe DOM changes (scrolling) to load more requests.

## 3. No External Communication
The Extension does not communicate with any external servers. There are no tracking scripts, analytics, or third-party APIs involved.

## 4. User Control
The Extension only operates when you are actively on the Follower Requests page. You can stop or disable the Extension at any time through your browser's extension management settings.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
